## Causal inference
Here are materials that we find useful in studying causal inference. Our lab hosts a `Causal AI Reading Group` that meets (in-person) weekly to read about causality and AI. Email Dr. Zhang if you are interested in joining us. 

### Textbooks
1. Pearl, Glymour, Jewell (2016). [Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/).
  - A short booklet that covers all basics about causal inference.
  - Very intuitive examples accompanied by clear math.
  - Illustrates the beauty of causal graphical models.

2. [Peng Ding](https://sites.google.com/site/pengdingpku/)(2023). [A First Course in Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18793.pdf).
  - A very new book (May 2023 1st version) that includes the latest advances at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning.
  - [R code and datasets](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZX3VEV) used in the book.
  - [Python code](https://github.com/apoorvalal/ding_causalInference_python)

3. Hernan and Robins (2023). [Causal Inference: What if](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/).
  - More tailed to biostatistics and health care.
  - Includes a time series chapter.

4. Pearl (2009). [Causality](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K/).
  - Fantastic. Good for readers who finish the shorter book (A Primer) and ready to dive deeper into causality.

5. Pearl (2018). [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/). 
  - Good storytelling even for non-scientists. A great gift for your parents and friends. 

6. Winship and Morgan (2013). [Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/counterfactuals-and-causal-inference/5CC81E6DF63C5E5A8B88F79D45E1D1B7). 
  - Covers causal graphs & potential outcomes, which is rare.

7. Imbens and Rubin (2015). [Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/71126BE90C58F1A431FE9B2DD07938AB). 
  - Potential outcome framework.

### Online tutorials and talks

1. Brady Neal. [Causal Inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfzO4IEMVUk&list=PLoazKTcS0Rzb6bb9L508cyJ1z-U9iWkA0&ab_channel=BradyNeal-CausalInference)
  - Succinct tutorials. Each video is several minutes long.
  - Fun to wathc. Brady makes excellent diagrams that are easy to understand.

2. [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/home?authuser=0).
  - Great speakers from all over the world working on causality.
  - Meets on Zoom almost every week. 


## EHR and informatics
Here are materials that we find useful in understanding electronic health record (EHR) data, data standards, and the field of biomedical informatics, especially clinical informatics. 

### OHDSI and OMOP
1. [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/).
  - This is a book about the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative.
  - Great resource to learn about OMOP common data model, OHDSI open-source analytics, and how to run network studies.

2. [OHDSI.org](https://ohdsi.org/)
  - OHDSI official website.
  - Latest updates about the community as well as recordings of past community and workgroup calls. 

3. [HADES](https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/)
  - HADES (formally known as the OHDSI Methods Library) is a set of open source R packages for large scale analytics, including population characterization, population-level causal effect estimation, and patient-level prediction.
  - Includes a clear step-by-step instructions on setting up the R environment for HADES and OHDSI studies. That's where the fun begins!
