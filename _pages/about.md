I am an assistant professor of Biostatistics at Washington University in St. Louis [Institute for Informatics, Data Science, & Biostatistics](https://i2db.wustl.edu). My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for causal inference with electronic health records.

I completed my PhD in Biomedical Informatics at [Columbia University](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu), advised by [George Hripcsak](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/hripcsak/) and [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/). I have a master's degree in Computational Biology from [Harvard School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) and a bachelor's degree from Boston University. 

Here is my [CV](https://linyingzhang.com/files/CV_linyingzhang.pdf).
